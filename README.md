This is a simple Compiler Optimization Visualizer, NOT a compiler itself.
It takes C code as input, and performs appropriate optimmization as selected.

To run this project, run the 'app.py' file using command 'python app.py', and open the server link in browser, then you're good to go.

Note: It assumes that the input C Code is syntactically correct.
